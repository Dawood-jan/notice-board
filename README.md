# Online Notice Board System

This project is designed to streamline the process of creating and distributing notices online, replacing manual notice systems. Admins can create notices specific to their respective departments, while students can only view notices relevant to their department. Additionally, students will receive email notifications prompting them to check new notices.

## Usage

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
Navigate to both the backend and frontend directories and install the required dependencies by running:

npm install

## Step 2: Start the Backend
Go to backend directory and start the server using:

npm start

## Step 3: Start the Frontend
Go to frontend directory and start the frontend server using:

npm run dev

## Step 4:
After starting the server, if you want to login as an admin go to app.js as the admins are created internally. if you want to sinup as a student then signup with real gmail as student will be receiving an email after notice is created.
